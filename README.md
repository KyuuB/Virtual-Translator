# Virtual-Translator

For VisualTranslator-Deliverable it was inspired and is credited to:
2 youtube videos who had outdated apps. I merged them togther to create a new app with/including a new API.
Youtube links will be posted once found.


The following code should be simple to run. Make sure you run the following code on Android Studio. We would highly recommend using a physical device instead of the simulator, so you can get a better use of the camera feature in the app. 

To get an android connected to Android Studio you need to have the physical device in developer mode. To get a physical device in developer mode all you need to do is go to settings. Go to About Phone then Software info and tap Build number seven times. This will enable developer mode on your phone and now you can access your physical device on Android Studio. Make sure to allow usb debugging once you connect your physical device to the computer. If you are still having trouble connecting your phone to Android Studio we recommend this video to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2oHD-06YcM . 

Once you have connected the device you can press run on Android Studio and the app should transfer successfully to your phone. Once transferred the app should be working on the phone. Again to make the app fully offline you might need to download the libraries first. So just select the languages you want to use by doing a quick translation and those languages libraries will download onto your phone. Now the app is fully offline. You donâ€™t need to download these libraries again for the future.

*VisualTranslator-Deliverable is the main app that is able to recognize text from images both from gallery and camera images. The recognizable text can vary from Korean, Japanese, Devanagari, Chinese, and Latin text. The recognized text is than translated to English.

*Translator-App-Secondary-Feature is a secondary feature/app that we tried to implement to the main app and because of time constraints we made two seperate apps. The Translator-App-Secondary-Feature application is able to take in a variety of language text and output a variety of language text.
